<h3><u>History</u></h3>
<img alt="Image Not Found" src="E:\\Software\Seed Notes\\java project info\\medical\\Bharti Vidypeeth medical colleg\\Dentalcollege.jpg" width="200" height="200" border="1">
Bharati Vidyapeeth had a very humble beginning. It was around 1963, when he was still a part-time school teacher that Patangrao 
Kadam was disturbed on seeing that not many Maharashtrian students could get admissions to national level institutions such as 
National Defence Academy or clear competitive examinations. He noted that the reason was a relatively weak foundation of these 
students in subjects such as English and Mathematics. The organisation was founded with the aim to bring about "intellectual 
awakening of people through the spread of education" and to "prepare human resources needed for all round development, 
particularly economic, of the country". Bharati Vidyapeeth, since its inception, started conducting competitive examinations for 
school going children in the area. This subsequently became its major activity, which still continues.
Bharati Vidyapeeth had its inception in a small room in a remote corner of an old part of Pune City. The onlookers then could 
not understand the word "Vidyapeeth" (University) in the name "Bharati Vidyapeeth". In the span of 40 years, Bharati Vidyapeeth 
grew to conduct more than 156 educational units of various kinds, right from pre-primary schools to postgraduate institutions 
and a university. With a view to promote research and to create a research culture on its campuses, It has established five 
specialized research institutes in the areas of Health Related Sciences, Biotechnology, Information Technology, Applied 
Chemistry and Social Sciences. It is probably the only organization from Maharashtra having i-ts campus in the capital city of India.
