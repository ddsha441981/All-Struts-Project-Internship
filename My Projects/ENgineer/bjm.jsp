<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sassoon General Hospitals is a large state-run hospital in Pune, India with 1296 beds. It is affiliated to the B. J. Medical College and a Nurses training School. Sassoon Hospital caters to 9,426,959 population of Pune District- a 2nd most populous district in the State of Maharashtra.
The Jewish philanthropist David Sassoon from Mumbai made a generous donation to make the construction of the hospital possible in 1867. The hospital could originally accommodate 144 patients.
In year 1946 on 23rd June, B. J. Medical College was founded to replace erstwhile B. J. Medical School, with Shri. B. G. Kher the head of the Bombay Government, laying the foundation stone. This was the fulfilment of the vision of a far sighted Parsi philanthropist Byramjee Jeejeebhoy, to have an institution in Poona for training of doctors and providing medical facilities on par with those in Bombay. His generosity and munificence made it possible for the B.J. Medical School to start functioning from 1871 on land donated by him, and when the school was upgraded to the college in 1946, quite filtergly the name was retained. The medical course of MBBS was affiliated to the University of Poona (Pune) in 1949.
Pune had already been blessed by the generous contribution of Sassoon- a Jewish merchant family in the form of the David Sassoon Hospital (Old Sassoon Building) built at a cost of Rs. 213,000 serving the poor and needy from 1867, and the Jacob Sassoon Hospital constructed by his nephew in 1905-06 to relieve the congestion on the David Sassoon Hospital. Both were magnificent buildings, architectural marvels and the clock tower of David Sassoon Hospital, a landmark in the city.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campus had already been blessed by the presence of two great personalities - Avtar Meher Baba was born in the old maternity ward in the hospital, and the father of the nation, Mahatma, Gandhi was operated upon for emergency appendectomy in 1924 by a British Surgeon Col. Murdoch with an Indian anaesthetist Dr. Datey in attendance.
On this hallowed ground, came up the B. J. Medical college (BJMC) and the Sassoon Hospital (New Sassoon Building) facing each other with a unique architectural style of both buildings having two white pillars bearing elephant heads at the top. The main building of BJMC was inaugurated by Dr. Radha Krishnan in 1952.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Principal of the B. J. Medical College, which started with 50 students, was Dr. B. B. Dikshit, a renowned academician and the quiet mastery of Dr. Bhende, discipline of Dr. Balwani have left an indelible imprint on the young impressionable minds of innumerable students, in their formative years, who in turn have imbibed these sterling qualities to give back the best to society. For many years annually 200 students are admitted for MBBS graduation and 143 for postgraduation. At any given time now 1700 students are on the campus with more than 2000 staff including 268 faculties. Presently, courses of MBBS, MD, MS, PhD, Diplomas, MCh (CVTS), MSc, GNM, BSc Nursing, DMLT, PGDMCH, and PGDGM are offered here.
Along the journey of learning the art and science, commerce of medicine, strong values were inculcated, attitudes shaped friendships forged minds were moulded and personalities groomed to give rise to renowned 'personalities' who carved a niche for themselves, in the world.
While on one hand many have reached dizzying heights of success and excellence in their chosen profession winning international acclaim, on the other hand, we have some for their unforgettable contribution to cinema and theatre. We have among ‘BJites’, dramatists trailing a blaze of glory, keen photographers clicking away, nature lover's trekking their way to the wild, litterateurs penning their thoughts in prose and poetry mountaineers climbing new heights and musicians rocking the stage. BJMC even finds a place in the political scenario with doctor politicians and astute administrators. The firm groundwork laid by Dr. Dikshit and his successor Dr. B. M. Desai, in establishing a rich tradition of excellent teaching, notable research and devoted service has been continued and built upon by successive eminent Deans, up to Dr. Ajay S. Chandanwale, in the present day. Their efforts to retain the good old values, while bringing in the new have resulted in our institution attaining a position of pre-eminence, rated among the top ten medical colleges in India.
