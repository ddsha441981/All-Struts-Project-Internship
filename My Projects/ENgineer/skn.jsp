<p>Smt. Kashibai Navale Medical College and General hospital is now equipped with 800 teaching beds, 74 ICU beds, 30 Casualty beds (including 5 OBGY Casualty beds). Named after the reverent mother of our founder president Prof. M. N. Navale, the hospital was started in the year 2006 with initial 300 beds and an outpatient department. In the last 8 years the bed strength has increased to almost three times the initial strength.
The Medical College which simultaneously started in September 2007, with an intake of 100 students for MBBS course, is affiliated with Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, Nasik and has sanction from Medical Council of India, New Delhi.<br>

Our MBBS degree is duly recognized by Medical Council of India and also by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, New Delhi.

<p>Post graduate courses in the subjects of Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Pathology, Microbiology, Community Medicine, Surgery, Ophthalmology, Orthopaedic, Gynaecology, Anaesthesia, Radiology, dermatology, Pulmonary Medicine and Pediatrics are carried out in the institute.
This year we added a new hospital building. The departments, wards and OPDs of Medicine, Paediatric, Surgery and Orthopaedics are shifted to this building. An AC Lecture hall having seating capacity of 200 is situated at the 7th floor of this building. We are maintaining much higher bed strength than required in the hospital to fulfil the social requirement
as the average daily OPD of our hospital during the year 2014 is 1803. We are still continuing to providing all the facilities of hospital in addition to two square meals to indoor patients totally free of cost to the patients. We still don't have a bill book!
